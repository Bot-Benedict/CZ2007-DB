# CZ2007-DB

This was an introductory course titled "Introduction to Databases". This repo contains the work done by my team and I, covering the requirements from Lab 1 through 5. The .ipynb included was used for generating dummy table queries large enough for the scope of the project.

## Description

The following was done in the notebook by the end of the project:
1. Lab 1 Submissions
2. ER Diagram
3. Queries for table creation and queries
